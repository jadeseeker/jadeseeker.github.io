					<h2>BlackThread : Predicting Malicious Intentions </h2>
					<p class="font">
					Classifying websites on how malicious or benign they are in nature is not an easy task. Many fall victim to visiting a malicious website that has the intent on downloading malware onto the victim’s computer to perform illicit activities. <br><br>Unfortunately, many antiviruses (AV) cannot prevent someone from visiting a malicious website. Web browsers even have a difficult time determining the intent of a website. Public blacklists for malicious domain names exist, but these seem to have fallen short of effective [9]. We propose Blackthread, a comprehensive toolkit that allows its user to determine the intentions (i.e., benign or malicious) of any given website. This toolkit is comprised of many different analysis techniques in order to give a thorough examination of any given website. It also includes a tool to determine how closely related a website’s content is to other categorized websites, such as sports, news, educational, etc.<br> <br>Our results show that our toolkit is effective, with ROC curves with areas of 93% for analyzing URLs and 96% for analyzing the structure of websites among other high values of success.<br><br>For more details please refer to this <a href="/files/blackthread.pdf">page.</a>

				<h2>Targeting Torrents</h2>
				<content>
					<p class="font">Peer-to-Peer traffic is increasingly becoming one of the most dominant form of data traffic observed over the internet. A majority of which can be attributed to file sharing services. But the rise of p2p services also poses a threat to our network and the connected devices. This threat appears in the form of torrent poisoning or p2p malwares. In this research we analyze traffic data from Georgia Tech subnet aiming to identify torrent/p2p usage and document such activities so that a better localized analysis might be conducted to create preventive measures against such threats.<br><br>For more details please refer to the <a href="/files/torrent.pdf">linked page.</a>

				<h2>Unified Services for Home Area Networks</h2>
				<content>
					<p class="font">Today we are surrounded by dozens of network enabled devices from dozens of manufacturers that make up our home network. These devices can be remote operated/monitored, but each device is managed by a different application and use different network protocols, making the management of these devices difficult. The objective of this paper is to evaluate these existing network technology implementations of a Home Area Network and to propose a new system for the unification all devices within single networked system. We begin with the analysis of the existing system utilized for the implementation of various device and services in a Home Area Network, the need for a new system and propose a new system. We further discuss the method of implementation of the proposed system and the use of cloud services to enhance its usability and its emergent features. Concluding with the future scalability of the system with the introduction newer systems like IPTV.<br><br>For more details please refer to this <a href="/files/broadband.pdf">page.</a>

				<h2>Technology/Computing Fosters Better Education</h2>
				<content>
					<p class="font">Today, we live in what is known as the Information Age where humanities access to all-encompassing information is literally a touch of a button away. But have we ever stopped to think, how all this technology has impact us, in the way we think, in the way we learn, in the way we educate ourselves. And has all these changes benefited us or has it caused harm. My Belief is that Technology/computing has only benefited us and that it fosters better education. This paper illustrates the benefits and opportunities the use of technology has afforded us and its use as a teaching aid, has had on education. We then weigh it against the harm, over-use or misuse of technology has caused, concluding with an evaluation of both the scenarios to reach a decision.<br><br>For more details please refer to the <a href="/files/tech.pdf">linked page.</a>

				<h2>Researching Networks</h2>
				<content>
					<p class="font">As a Network Researcher, it is imperative to have experience with Simulation packages to implement and test emerging network protocols and observe various network behaviours. To this effect I have worked with ns-2, ns-3, pyretic and mininet simulation environments. Some of the course related works can be found on my GitHub page.
